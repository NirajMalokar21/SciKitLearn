# Machine Learning Algorithms Repository

This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks where I explore and implement classical **machine learning algorithms** on different datasets. Each notebook demonstrates the full workflow of applying ML models — from **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **data preprocessing** to **model training, evaluation, and visualization**.

## What’s Inside
- **Linear Regression** – predicting continuous values, feature correlation analysis  
- **Logistic Regression** – binary/multiclass classification with decision boundaries  
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** – classification with kernel tricks and margin optimization  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – instance-based learning with distance metrics for classification and regression  
- (More algorithms will be added as I continue exploring)

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **pandas**, **NumPy** – data preprocessing and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – data visualization and result interpretation  
- **scikit-learn** – ML models, training, and evaluation
